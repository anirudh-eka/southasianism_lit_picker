# Horizontal Axis
The *hue* on the horizontal axis measures the religious origin of the quotations. 

On the extremes lie green and saffron corresponding to Islam and Hinduism, respectively. here, the quotes are in the context of purely Islam or Hinduism. As the hue enters the meshing point between these two, the text is authored by other traditions that have been influenced from both religions, such as Sikhism.
