On paper Hinduism and Islam couldn't be more different. The former boasts a pantheon of thousands of deities often revered in the form of idols, while the later instructs that there is only one God and to pray to an idol is a sin. However, despite these differences, both religions have shared South Asia as a home for over a thousand years. 

The color picker below is a model to explore the meshing between these two religions at different layers. Click on various points in the color picker to discover quotes from scholars, poets, mystics, and religious texts from Islam, Hinduism and the traditions in-between!

## Understanding the Axis

The *saturation* level on the verticle axis mesures the philosophical nature of the quotations. Where the saturation is highest, you will notice the text is instructional dictating what rituals followers should perform, what clothes they should wear, and other outward activities. As the saturation declines towards white, the text becomes less dictatorial and more phylosophical engaging the rational mind.

The *hue* on the horizontal axis measures the religious origin of the quotations. On the extremes lie green and saffron corresponding to Islam and Hinduism, respectively. here, the quotes are in the context of purely Islam or Hinduism. As the hue enters the meshing point between these two, the text is authored by other traditions that have been influenced from both religions, such as Sikhism. 
 

## Conflict between Hues and between Saturations

The conflict between various Hues, that is between different religious traditions is age old. These conflicts take the form of crusades, persecution, preferential treatment based on religion, and now in modern South Asia as communal violence. It is what has led to the breakup of British India into three countries. This conflict in my opinion is too familiar to need more exploration.

What I find more interesting is the conflict between different Saturations within the same Hue.
