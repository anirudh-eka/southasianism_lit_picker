On paper Hinduism and Islam couldn't be more different. The former boasts a pantheon of thousands of deities often revered in the form of idols, while the later instructs that there is only one God and to pray to an idol is a sin. However, despite these differences, both religions have shared South Asia as a home for over a thousand years.

## Conflict between Hues and between Saturations

The conflict between various Hues, that is between different religious traditions is age old. These conflicts take the form of crusades, persecution, preferential treatment based on religion, and now in modern South Asia as communal violence. It is what has led to the breakup of British India into three countries. This conflict in my opinion is too familiar to need more exploration.
