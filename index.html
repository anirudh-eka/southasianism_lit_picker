    <h1><a href="#">Explore South Asian Spirtuality</a></h1>
    <div class="post">
      <p>On paper Hinduism and Islam couldn't be more different. The former bostes a pantheon of thousands of deities often revered in the form of idols, while the later instructs that there is only one God and to pray to an idol is a sin. However, despite these differences, both religions have shared South Asia as a home for over a thousand years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes there was violence between the religions</li>
<li>Merged either in to new practices like Sikhism</li>
<li>Sometimes , in which I find most intersting, members of each religion, remove themselves from the daily rituals into contemplating what exactly God, existence, even means. At those times, it seems that there is no difference. That Allah and Brahman are synoyms.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is true humility. Acknowledgement that the human mind is feeble in understanding the true 'oneness' of the universe/God/Allah/Brahman... In fact to try to understand and explain it is to chop up reality that is to chop</p>
<p>To capture this idea that as people from either faith contemplate more abstractly about the nature of reality, they shed the layers of ritual that make the faiths distinguishable, I devised the color picker below as a model. Explore words from scholars, poets, mystics, and religious texts by clicking on various points of the box.</p>
